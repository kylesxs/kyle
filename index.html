                Saying those three words just ain’t enough
So I try to give you all my love
We can do the things that you always wanted
Make it possible there’s nothing that can stop it
We can bake and judge on who’s the best
We can build your favorite Lego set
Are you down to go and have a little car ride
Everything is great as long as you’re by my side
Tell me what you need
‘Cause I’ll be here
As long as it’s you
Let me buy you flowers
Let me take you out on dates
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
If you need a lover
I’ll be a call away
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
Simply just because
And you know that music’s what I do
And all my songs are written just for you
You’re the ballerina in my jukebox
Spinning like the muse I always dream of
We can paint the walls back in my place
We won’t stop ‘til we’re covered up in paint
Everything about you is just gorgeous
And you know that
Baby yeah you know that
Tell me what you need
‘Cause I’ll be here
As long as it’s you (you know that it’s true baby)
Let me buy you flowers
Let me take you out on dates
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
Tell me your favorite songs
And I'll be the one to play
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
Simply just because
No reason baby
‘Cause it’s that easy
To give you love
I won’t hesitate to show you more

We won’t stop ‘til we’re covered up in paint
Everything about you is just gorgeous
And you know that
Baby yeah you know that
Tell me what you need
‘Cause I’ll be here
As long as it’s you (you know that it’s true baby)
Let me buy you flowers
Let me take you out on dates
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
Tell me your favorite songs
And I'll be the one to play
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
Simply just because
No reason baby
‘Cause it’s that easy
To give you love
I won’t hesitate to show you more
No reason baby
‘Cause it’s that easy
To give you love
I won’t hesitate to show you more
Let me buy you flowers
Let me take you out on dates
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
There are things that I regret
Except the first day that we met
And that’s why I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
Simply just becauseSaying those three words just ain’t enough
So I try to give you all my love
We can do the things that you always wanted
Make it possible there’s nothing that can stop it
We can bake and judge on who’s the best
We can build your favorite Lego set
Are you down to go and have a little car ride
Everything is great as long as you’re by my side
Tell me what you need
‘Cause I’ll be here
As long as it’s you
Let me buy you flowers
Let me take you out on dates
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
If you need a lover
I’ll be a call away
‘Cause baby I love, I love, I love
To love you everyday
Simply just because
And you know that music’s what I do
And all my songs are written just for you
You’re the ballerina in my jukebox
Spinning like the muse I always dream of
We can paint the walls back in my place
We won’t stop ‘til we’re covered up in paint
Everything about you is just gorgeous
And you know that
Baby yeah you know that
Tell me what you need
‘Cause I’ll be here
As long as it’s you (you know that it’s true baby)
